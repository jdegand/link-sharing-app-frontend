# Link Sharing App Frontend

This is inspired by the [Link Sharing App Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/linksharing-app-Fbt7yweGsT). I have taken some liberties, as the design does not fully account for authentication.

## Built With

- [Angular](https://angular.dev)
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.
- [PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/)
- [PrimeIcons](https://primeng.org/icons)

## Thoughts

- I started the app by building out the dynamic reactive form to add the links.
- I used `FormBuilder`. FormBuilder has implications for adding custom validators, as there can be extra snags and TypeScript issues.
- This [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-custom-validator-formgroup-formarray?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts) was a great help.
- I had included the errors in the wrong place, so I moved the error message conditional statement into the `for` loop for the link controls. This change helped to localize the errors for each link group.
- Creating a regex to handle every error scenario and URL deviation is very difficult and time-consuming. It is very difficult to trust a regex. Using a custom validator seems to be the best choice to make sure the URL matches the selected platform.
- I went through many changes to the regex. I also looked into using the [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) inside a custom validator to validate the URL value.
- Material Design icons have removed all third-party icons. See [Github](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/issues/166) for more. `facebook` still works, but it is deprecated and will be removed shortly. None of the other select options have working icons. It would have been nice just to use a `mat-icon` inside a `mat-option` of a `mat-select`. This really negates a big benefit of switching the form to an Angular Material form.
- Adding a little icon to each input is a lot more involved than it really should be.
- I also had problems using `mat-label` and the `for` attribute with a dynamic index. I had to add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to the schemas array of the home component to use the `for` attribute.
- After removing the `for` attributes and just using `mat-label`, Chrome complained about there being no `id` matching the generated `for` attribute.
- I also had trouble getting the `mat-select` working correctly.
- If you have to add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`, you probably have a misconfiguration.
- Ultimately, I think there is limited benefit in converting the form to use Angular Material.
- I did some research and decided to use `PrimeNG` and `PrimeIcons`.
- PrimeNG has third-party icons. It is almost as feature complete as Angular Material (I would later find out that it doesn't have any copy-to-clipboard features).
- PrimeNG doesn't have an `ng add` command, so you have to add theme styles to the `angular.json` yourself.
- Prime icons require a single import in the global `styles.css` file.
- `FormField doesn't have a name or id` warning in the browser console, so I added a name with the `index` to the URL input.
- It is tough to associate a label with the dropdown. The `ng-template` cannot take an ID.
- I think the ng-template loop creates IDs for each dropdown option.
- The dropdown's `name` property is `platform`.
- Firefox doesn't show an error for the label. Firefox had quite a few warnings associated with the `PrimeNG` styling.
- To fix this label issue, I may have to refactor again.
- In Chrome, the error choice is `incorrect label use` or `no label associated with a form field`.
- I used the [Messages Module](https://primeng.org/messages) to show inline errors on the forms.
- `visible` in the menubar does not update from state changes. It is only evaluated once.
- Is it best to localize the navbar per page versus adding it once to the `app` component? This strategy would lead to a lot of duplicated code.
- `PrimeNG` has a design philosophy to minimize conditionals in templates.
- One strategy I have seen for PrimeNG navbars is to use `ngIf` to conditionally render them. Basically, you show no menubar when unauthenticated. I searched Github, and [this](https://github.com/softrams/bulwark/blob/master/frontend/src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html) is an example of that strategy.
- Initially, I used a `computed` signal to update the menu items. Since I am using a signal for the auth state, this made sense, and I was able to toggle menu items. However, when I tried to add `visible` and `fragment` to the menubar, I encountered problems.
- `computed` menubar fragments are missing on first-run navigation. You can use `visible` to have the links added when the fragment is available. I envisioned using either approach to allow the profile route to be unique and shareable.
- I don't think the fragments are `recomputed` inside `computed` or `effect`. See this [Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76312588/angular-effects-and-conditional-use-of-signals).
- I changed to use `effect` in the navbar component, as `computed` is not intended to have conditionals. See [Github](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49161) for more.
- Using `computed` or `effect` did not change the fact that fragment and visible parameters were not evaluated in time for the first navigation to a route, so I created a separate `public-profile` page that can be shared.
- I initially used the [Realworld API](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/frontend-specs/api) and my [Angular Auth repo](https://github.com/jdegand/angular-auth) as a starting point for authentication.
- Using a signal for authentication state is a [new strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8a8ituFkls). See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foUS5JlDlCs) for how signals and RxJs can work together for authentication.
- Creating a simple guard to prevent a user from visiting `login` and `register` when authenticated was difficult.
- Since auth signal is only saved in memory, a refresh or typing a URL erases the signal state. By persisting the auth signal, you can add a guard to `register` and `login`. A user visits the routes, but sees nothing on the page besides the navbar.
- Even if you conditionally remove links from the menubar, a user can visit those routes typing the correct URL.
- Instead of using a guard for the `register` and `login` pages, you can check for the auth signal in the constructor and redirect based on the state of the auth signal. I got the idea from looking at this [Github project](https://github.com/joshuamorony/angularstart-chat/blob/main/src/app/auth/login/login.component.ts).
- Signals and guards are a problematic combination. If you change the signal to an observable, you create a memory leak. See [Github](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51280) for more.
- I used [FileUpload](https://primeng.org/fileupload) to save a profile picture.
- I did not add the `FileUpload` component to the existing form originally. I used the `url` action to send the file to the backend. I used the `onUpload` and `onError` methods to handle successful and unsuccessful API responses. I refactored to send `formData` back to the backend. You have to loop over the `formData` object to see the values and you will have to ignore TypeScript issues.
- To reset the file input, I used a `ViewChild` ref. I tried to pass a form template variable on the file input to the `onUpload` function and call the `clear` method inside that function, but it did not work, although the file was correctly saved. `ViewChild` is an easy way to grab the template variable, and you can call the `clear` method on the `ViewChild` variable. I had to use `any` for the TypeScript type. I fixed the typing for the `ViewChild` variable by using `ElementRef`.
- PrimeNG does not have a `Clipboard` component. [Angular Material CDK](https://material.angular.io/cdk/clipboard/overview) has a clipboard directive. In lieu of adding that dependency, I used the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API). The clipboard API can be blocked by the [Permissions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API) if you don't use the clipboard API in conjunction with a user click.
- Using binding, you can sanitize (albeit not fully (hrefs are still displayed)) DOM input. The profile image is `base64` and I did not sanitize it. I used `src="data:{{userInfo.profile.fileType}};base64,{{userInfo.profile.img}}"` inside the `img` tag. I could not bind the image value to `[src]` because the type of `img` was `File`. I needed to change it to `string` for the binding to work. I duplicated `UserInfoDto` into `Preview` and created a separate `ProfileDto` with `img` being set to `string`. This is a marginal improvement. If you were to inject and use `DomSanitizer`, I think it might be best to construct the string separately and save the sanitized output to another variable that you would then use in the template.
- I used `take` to unsubscribe from my observables. You could manually call `unsubscribe` or convert to a declarative approach with async pipe.
- I have a jwt decoder service that can be used in combination with the auth guard to prevent a user from accessing routes if the jwt is expired. I have not done that, as the interceptor can refresh the access token. So a user with an expired token can access the links and profile pages and the token will be refreshed when those page's forms are submitted. The preview page refreshes on route navigation.
- Initially, I had a simple, functional interceptor. I converted that to a class based interceptor. The interceptor does a lot, and it could be possible to refactor into multiple interceptors. The backend had problems when an expired token header was attached to refresh token requests. Although the refresh route permitted all users, an `ExpiredJwtException` would still be thrown and prevent a response back to the frontend. I refactored to make sure the header would not be set at all on refresh requests.
- I have two different API requests (`GET` and `POST`) to get the refresh token.
- [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/205651) does not plan on supporting the new Angular control flow syntax. Apparently, [JS Beautify](https://github.com/beautifier/js-beautify/issues/2219) is used by VS Code, and it added control flow formatting that is not perfect, so the formatting option for it is turned off by default. It seems like it will be some time before formatting for the new control flow syntax is handled error-free. `Prettier` may be necessary.
- I periodically add linting with `ng add @angular-eslint/schematics`. I lint, fix the errors, and remove the dependencies.
- The register page's `p-password` and label were incorrectly associated. The documentation was not clear. This [Github issue](https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/13952) shows a solution, but there still seems to be issues with the `p-password` component.
- A lot of PrimeNG components have accessibility issues. I used `ariaLabelledBy` to get around issues where a label `for` attribute would not work.
- Very easy to toggle themes in PrimeNG.

## Continued Development

- Allow multiple links for same platform? Need another custom validator to prevent it?
- Styling
- Drag and Drop functionality on Preview page
- Testing (I left the Karma and Jasmine packages installed)
- TypeScript improvements. Zod?
- Best to refactor `Preview` template into more components?
- Convert class based interceptor into a functional interceptor? Refresh token expiration ?
